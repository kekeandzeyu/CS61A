# UC Berkeley CS61A Study Notes

## 1 Introduction

In this repository, I've packed all the detailed solutions of labs, homework and projects in CS61A. Solutions of labs and homework are just downloaded from the CS61A website, although I've done them myself as well, since I believe the official ones can provide more slternative solutions than my own. Solutions of projects are implemented by myself.
