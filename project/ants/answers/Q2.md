None
>>> print(place0.entrance)
None
>>> place1 = Place('place_1', place0)
>>> place1.exit is place0
True
>>> place0.entrance is place1
True
```

## Suite 2 Case 2

```Python
>>> # Testing if entrances are properly initialized
>>> tunnel_len = 9
>>> len(gamestate.bee_entrances)
1
>>> tile_1 = gamestate.bee_entrances[0]
>>> tile_2 = tile_1.exit
>>> tile_3 = tile_2.exit
>>> tile_1.entrance is gamestate.beehive
True
>>> tile_1.exit is tile_2
True
>>> tile_2.entrance is tile_1
True
>>> tile_2.exit is tile_3
True
>>> tile_3.entrance is tile_2
