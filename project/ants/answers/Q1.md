# Q1

## Suite 1 Case 1

Q: What is the purpose of the food_cost attribute?

Choose the number of the correct choice:

0) Placing an ant into the colony will decrease the colony's total available food by that ant's food_cost

1) Each turn, each Ant in the colony adds food_cost food to the colony's total available food

2) Each turn, each Ant in the colony eats food_cost food from the colony's total available food

0

## Suite 1 Case 2

Q: What type of attribute is food_cost?

Choose the number of the correct choice:

0) instance, the food_cost of an Ant depends on the location it is placed

1) class, all Ants cost the same to place no matter what type of Ant it is

2) instance, the food_cost of an Ant is randomized upon initialization

3) class, all Ants of the same subclass cost the same to place

3

## Suite 2 Case 1

```Python
>>> from ants import *
>>> from ants_plans import *
>>> Ant.food_cost
0
>>> HarvesterAnt.food_cost
2
>>> ThrowerAnt.food_cost
3
```

## Suite 2 Case 2

```Python
>>> from ants import *
>>> from ants_plans import *
>>> # Testing HarvesterAnt action
>>> # Create a test layout where the colony is a single row with 9 tiles
>>> beehive = Hive(make_test_assault_plan())
>>> gamestate = GameState(beehive, ant_types(), dry_layout, (1, 9))
>>> #
>>> gamestate.food = 4
>>> harvester = HarvesterAnt()
>>> # Note: initializing an Ant doesn't cost food,
>>> # only deploying an Ant in the game layout does.
>>> # For this test case, Ants can still take actions
>>> # without being deployed in the game layout.
>>> #
>>> gamestate.food
4
>>> harvester.action(gamestate) # executing harvester's action method. this symbolizes the ant taking one turn.
>>> gamestate.food
5
>>> harvester.action(gamestate) # harvester's action is executed again.
>>> gamestate.food
